# FaceSync: Deep Learning Face Recognition System

FaceSync is a comprehensive face recognition system built with PyTorch that allows you to train your own face recognition model from scratch and use it for face verification and authentication. The system leverages deep learning techniques and provides both Google Colab and local execution environments.

## üìã System Overview

FaceSync leverages the following components:
1. **Dataset Download**: Automated download of face recognition datasets
2. **Preprocessing**: Extracting and preparing face images for training
3. **Model Training**: Fine-tuning a deep neural network on your dataset
4. **Face Recognition**: Real-time face verification and authentication

## üîç Requirements

The complete list of requirements is in `requirements.txt`. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Google Colab Setup

Follow these steps to run the entire FaceSync system in Google Colab:

### Step 1: Upload the Scripts to Google Colab

Create a new Colab notebook and upload all Python files to the notebook environment:
- download_dataset.py
- PreProcessing_dataset.py
- train_model.py
- faceid_app.py
- kaggle.json (for dataset download)

### Step 2: Set Up Cells for Each Component

#### Cell 1: Install Dependencies

```python
!pip install torch torchvision facenet-pytorch opencv-python tqdm matplotlib mtcnn kaggle mxnet pillow
```

#### Cell 2: Download Dataset

```python
# Upload kaggle.json
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()  # Upload your kaggle.json file here

# Load download_dataset.py and execute it
%%writefile download_dataset.py
# [Copy the entire content of download_dataset.py here]

# Run the dataset downloader
!python download_dataset.py --dataset casia-webface
```

#### Cell 3: Preprocess the Dataset

```python
# Load PreProcessing_dataset.py and execute it
%%writefile PreProcessing_dataset.py
# [Copy the entire content of PreProcessing_dataset.py here]

# Import and run the preprocessing
from PreProcessing_dataset import process_casia_webface
processed_path = process_casia_webface('/content/datasets/casia-webface')
print(f"Dataset preprocessed at: {processed_path}")
```

#### Cell 4: Train the Model

```python
# Load train_model.py and execute it
%%writefile train_model.py
# [Copy the entire content of train_model.py here]

# Import the preprocessing module to make it available for training
from PreProcessing_dataset import FaceDataset, process_casia_webface

# Run the training process
!python train_model.py
```

#### Cell 5: Run Face Recognition Application

```python
# Load faceid_app.py and execute it
%%writefile faceid_app.py
# [Copy the entire content of faceid_app.py here]

# Run the Face ID application in Colab mode
!python faceid_app.py
```

## üíª Local Execution

To run FaceSync on your local machine after training on Colab:

1. First download the trained model from Colab:
   - In Colab, run the Face ID app and use option 5 to download the model files
   - Save them to your local `models` directory

2. Then run the face recognition app locally:
   ```bash
   python faceid_app.py
   ```

## üìä System Components in Detail

### 1. Dataset Download (`download_dataset.py`)

This script downloads the CASIA-WebFace dataset (or alternative datasets) using the Kaggle API:

```python
# Example usage
python download_dataset.py --dataset casia-webface
```

Options:
- `--dataset`: Choose from `casia-webface`, `vggface2`, or `lfw`
- `--output_dir`: Directory to save the downloaded dataset

### 2. Dataset Preprocessing (`PreProcessing_dataset.py`)

This script prepares the raw dataset for training by:
- Converting from RecordIO format if needed
- Filtering out low-quality samples
- Creating a PyTorch dataset class

```python
# Example usage
from PreProcessing_dataset import process_casia_webface
processed_path = process_casia_webface('path/to/dataset')
```

### 3. Model Training (`train_model.py`)

This script trains the face recognition model on the preprocessed dataset:

```python
# Example usage
python train_model.py --data_path /content/datasets/processed_casia --epochs 10
```

Key features:
- Fine-tunes a pre-trained neural network
- Uses GPU acceleration
- Saves checkpoints during training
- Generates training history plots

### 4. Face Recognition Application (`faceid_app.py`)

This script provides a user interface for face registration and verification:

```python
# Example usage
python faceid_app.py
```

Features:
- Register new faces with multiple samples
- Verify faces in real-time
- Manage registered users
- Works in both Colab (with file uploads) and local environments (with webcam)

## üîß Customization

You can customize various aspects of the system:
- Change the dataset by using a different dataset option
- Adjust training hyperparameters in train_model.py
- Modify the verification threshold in faceid_app.py
- Train on your own dataset by organizing it in the required format

## üõ† Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **Kaggle API errors**: Ensure your kaggle.json file is properly set up
- **CUDA out of memory**: Reduce batch size in train_model.py
- **Face detection failures**: Ensure proper lighting and face positioning
- **Model loading errors**: Make sure the model files are in the correct directory

## üîó Model Architecture

FaceSync uses a neural network architecture based on the Inception-ResNet design, but with custom modifications for improved face recognition performance. The model is trained using triplet loss to ensure that faces of the same person are closer in embedding space than faces of different people.
